- **Professional logging** and debugging support

## 📊 Live Test Results

### **Real-World Detection Success:**
```json
{
  "notifications": [
    {
      "type": "comment",
      "username": "brisa_meza19", 
      "actionTaken": "replied to your tweet",
      "content": "Replying to @mzeeshanaly everyone know this"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "totalFound": 2,
    "comments": 2, 
    "mentions": 0
  }
}
```

### **Key Improvements Made:**
- **Before**: Found 0 relevant notifications
- **After**: ✅ **Successfully finding comments and mentions**
- **Before**: Detected login alerts as comments  
- **After**: ✅ **Smart filtering removes system notifications**
- **Before**: Poor content extraction
- **After**: ✅ **Clean, meaningful content extraction**

## 🎯 Technical Implementation

### **Enhanced Detection Patterns:**
- ✅ **"Replying to @username"** patterns 
- ✅ **"mentioned you in"** patterns
- ✅ **Direct reply/comment detection**
- ✅ **Quote tweet identification**
- ✅ **System notification filtering**

### **API Endpoint:**
```bash
# Works with empty requests (as required)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/notification

# Works with custom parameters  
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/notification \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"maxNotifications": 10, "includeOlderNotifications": true}'
```

### **Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "Notification check completed successfully",
    "notifications": [/* Array of notification objects */],
    "summary": {
      "totalFound": 2,
      "comments": 2,
      "mentions": 0,
      "verifiedUsers": 0
    },
    "options": {/* Request parameters used */},
    "duration": "38959ms",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-11T11:09:17.177Z"
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Code Quality

### **Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation errors** resolved
- ✅ **Import/export problems** fixed
