2. **Access Developer Tools**:
   - Press `F12` or right-click anywhere and select "Inspect Element"
   - This will open the browser's Developer Tools panel

3. **Find the WebSocket URL**:
   - In the Developer Tools, click on the three dots menu (â‹®) in the top right corner
   - Select "More tools" > "Remote devices"
   - Look for text that says "DevTools listening on..." which contains your WebSocket URL
